# Binary-Gray-Converter

## Project Specifications

Implement an 8-bit Binary-to-Gray code converter for the value applied to the input port A. The result C will be displayed through the LEDs on the BASYS 3 development board. The description of the converter will be done in VHDL in the behavioral model.

## Features
- The Gray code is a reflected binary code, which has the property that two adjacent numbers differ by the value of a single bit.
- In the input port A, signals representing numbers in binary code are introduced.
- Any numbers up to 8 bits can be entered.
- The input signals, representing numbers in binary code, are converted to output signals representing numbers in Gray code.
- In the output port C, signals representing numbers in Gray code are displayed through the LEDs on the development board.
